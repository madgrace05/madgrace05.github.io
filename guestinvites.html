				<h1>Step 1: Make print and cut-outs</h1>
				<h3><dt>I made mine by using Google Slides and a free website called <a href="http://www.remove.bg">RemoveBG</a> (it removes backgrounds).</p></dt></h3>
				<dd> Make sure that you have the following items for printing:
				<ol>
				<li>invitation pages (enough for all the people your inviting and add one extra)</li>
				<li>images of things like flowers, bows, and buttons that you can cut and glue to add decoration to the invite</li>
				<li>name labels or anything you would like to add to the envelope</li>
				</dd>
				</ol><br>
				
				<h3>Make sure to include this information on the invite pages</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Where the party is going to be
					<li>Where to park cars
					<li>What time the party will start and end
					<li>What day the party will be on
					<li>How to contact you with questions
					<li>How to RSVP (I told them to text me and gave my number)
					<li>What to wear (I asked my guests to wear an all white outfit and I wore a colorful dress)
					<li>and other things like what to bring and what food will be there
				
				<h1>Step 2: Gather materials</h1>
			<h3><p>This step is definitely the most important one! No guests = no party!</p></h3>
				<dt>What you need to collect:</dt>
				<ul><br>
				<li>scissors
				<li>hot glue and glue stick
				<li>colorful cardstock paper
				<li>invite print-out 
				<li>collage print-outs 
				</ul>
				
				<h1>Step 3: Assemble invites</h1>
				<h3><dt>Make sure you give yourself enough time to thoughtfully put the invites together! I suggest putting on your fave show!</p></dt></h3>
				<dd> Follow these steps to make cute invites:
				<ol><br>
				<li>make sure you have enough of your materials and have cut out all of your print outs.</li>
				<li>start by glueing the invite pages to the colorful cardstock paper.</li>
				<li>add any print out images to the invites to give them a little creativity.</li>
				<li>make the envelops by adding the guest's name and some decorations. Don't forget to add the address and return address if you plan on actually mailing the invites.</li>
